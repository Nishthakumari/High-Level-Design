Command Query Request Segregation

Command- create, update, delete

Query - select

Query join, how to do???

S1-T1   S2-T2
How to join both table??
 we cant because they are in different database.

 Now we will create a seperate view, which contain data of table1 and table2 both.

 Create, update, delete will be done on its own DB.

 But all the read operations will be done on new DB view.

 Now the challenge is how will this DB view will keep itself updated???

 Whenever create, delete, or update happens in any database, it will publish event to 
 the view, Then view will perform all those operation on itsel too.



 We can also use DB triggger or procedure.

 Whenever there is create, update, or delete, then a procedure will run, and it will update view tooo.
