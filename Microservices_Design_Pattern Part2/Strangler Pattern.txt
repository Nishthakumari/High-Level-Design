Strangler Pattern is used when we are refactoring to microservices. 
We already have  a monolithics service.

We have to make it into microservices. and from decomposition pattern, we know that in how many part
should we divide it.

How to refactor the code of monolithics to microservices?? It is goverened by strangler pattern.

Suppose there ia a controller. And we are getting some API traffic in this controller.

Now we have just started converting monolithics to microservices. We have just designed a flow in 
microservices.

Then we can take particular flow or 10% traffic in that microservices.

supoose we sent 10% traffic to microservice, but it is giving some error. 
So we will stop sending traffic to microservice and send all traffic to monolithics, untillt the bug is resolved.

Slowly if we keep getting confidence, we will keep incresing traffic to microservice, ultimately to 100%.

We cant never convert a single monolithics completely to microservice and then take traffic.
